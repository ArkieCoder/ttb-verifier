The manufacturer shall retain, in the records required by § 17.170, any authorization given by the appropriate TTB officer under this section.

This amount shall not exceed the limitations prescribed for each surety company by the Secretary, as stated in Department of the Treasury Circular 570. If the sureties limit their liability in this way, the total of the limited liabilities shall equal the required amount of the bond.</P>

Each claim shall pertain only to distilled spirits used in the manufacture or production of nonbeverage products during any one quarter of the tax year. Unless the manufacturer is eligible to file monthly claims (see §§ 17.143 and 17.144), only one claim per quarter may be filed for each place of business. Claims shall be filed on TTB Form 2635 (5620.8), Claim—Alcohol and Tobacco Taxes.

Adjustments resulting from an approved drawback claim are not subject to interest. This procedure may be utilized only if the manufacturer of nonbeverage products and the distilled spirits plant have the same employer identification number.

                    <P>Distilled spirits are considered to have been used in the manufacture of a product under this part if the spirits are consumed in the manufacture, are incorporated into the product, or are determined by TTB to have been otherwise utilized as an essential part of the manufacturing process. However, spirits lost by causes such as spillage, leakage, breakage or theft, and spirits used for purposes such as rinsing or cleaning a system, are not considered to have been used in the manufacture of a product.</P>

                         Distilled spirits shall be considered used in the manufacture of a product as soon as that product contains all the ingredients called for by its formula.

                         Distilled spirits used in recharging an ion exchange column, the operation of which is essential to the production of a product, shall be considered to be used when the spirits are entered into the manufacturing system in accordance with the product's formula.

                         Further manipulation of a product, such as aging or filtering, subsequent to the mixing together of all of its ingredients, shall not postpone the time when spirits are considered used, as determined under paragraph (a) of this section. This is true even if at the time of use there has not yet been a final determination of alcoholic content by assay. If, however, it is later found necessary to add more distilled spirits to standardize the product, such added spirits shall be considered as used in the period during which they were added.

                         Nonbeverage products may be used to manufacture other nonbeverage (or intermediate) products. However, such subsequent usage of a nonbeverage product shall not affect the time when the distilled spirits contained therein are considered used. When distilled spirits are used in the manufacture of a nonbeverage product, the time of use shall be the point at which that product first contains all of its prescribed ingredients, and such use shall not be determined by the time of any subsequent usage of that product in another product.

                         Distilled spirits recovered in the manufacture of a nonbeverage product are considered as having been used in the manufacture of that product. If the spirits were eligible when so used, they became subject to drawback at that time. Upon recovery, such spirits may be reused in the manufacture of nonbeverage products, but shall not be reused for any other purpose. When reused, such recovered spirits are not again eligible for drawback and shall not be used in the manufacture of intermediate products.

The amount received in bottles may be determined by the required statements on the labels. The amount received in sealed drums with no evidence of leakage may be determined from the record of shipment, which is required by § 19.626 of this chapter to accompany spirits received from a distilled spirits plant. If spirits are received in a tank car or tank truck, and the result of the manufacturer's gauge of the spirits is within 0.2 percent of the number of proof gallons reported on the record of shipment required by § 19.626, then the number of proof gallons reported on that record may be recorded as the quantity received. Nevertheless, the receiving gauge shall be noted on the record of receipt. If, for any shipment, the amount recorded in the manufacturer's records as the quantity received is greater than the amount shown as taxpaid on the record required by § 19.626, a deduction equivalent to the excess shall be made from the amount of drawback claimed in the manufacturer's claim covering that period. If no claim is filed for that period, then the deduction shall be made in the manufacturer's next claim. Losses in transit that exceed the 0.2 percent limitation provided in this paragraph shall be determined and noted on the record of receipt. Such losses shall not be recorded as distilled spirits received.

However, when needed for protection of the revenue, the appropriate TTB officer may at any time require the keeping of these records upon giving at least five days' notice to the manufacturer.

Spirits taxpaid at different effective tax rates shall be inventoried separately. The inventory record shall show the date inventory was taken, the person(s) by whom it was taken, subtotals for each product inventoried, and any gains or losses disclosed; and shall be retained with the manufacturer's records. The manufacturer shall explain in Part IV of the supporting data (Form 5154.2) any discrepancy between the amounts on hand as disclosed by physical inventory and the amounts indicated by the manufacturer's records. Any gain in eligible spirits disclosed by inventory requires an equivalent deduction from the claim with which the inventory is reported. Gains shall not be offset by known losses. If no claim is filed for a quarter (nor for any monthly period therein), then no physical inventory is required for that quarter.

The results of such inventories shall be recorded in the manufacturer's records. Any discrepancy between the amounts on hand as disclosed by physical inventory and such amounts as indicated by the manufacturer's records shall also be recorded with an explanation of its cause.
