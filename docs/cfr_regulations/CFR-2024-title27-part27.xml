                        (b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to the nearest whole cent, and

Payment of such taxes by cash, check, or money order is not 
                        <PRTPAGE P="939"/>
                        authorized for an importer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is to be summarized separately for distilled spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer taxes, and is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals from premises in the United States and importations (including products of the same tax class brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by the taxpayer.
                    </P>
                    <P>(b) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.</P>
                    <P>(c) Electronic fund transfer or EFT means any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic tape, so as to order, instruct, or authorize a financial institution to either debit or credit an account, in accordance with procedures established by the U.S. Customs Service.</P>
                    <P>(d) An importer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT shall make the EFT remittance in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Customs Service.</P>

                    <P>(c) Where a standard effective tax rate has been previously approved for a product, an importer, in lieu of having a standard effective tax rate established, may use that rate.

                         Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an importer of natural wine must have an original or copy of a certification from the producing country stating that the practices and procedures used to produce the imported wine constitute proper cellar treatment. The importer of bottled wine must be in possession of the certificate at the time of filing the entry with CBP, and the bottler of bulk wine must be in possession of the certificate at the time the wine is withdrawn from the premises where bottled. The importer or bottler, as appropriate, must provide the certificate upon request by the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer. This requirement may be satisfied by providing the original certification, or a photocopy or electronic copy of the certification. The appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer may request, and the importer or bottler must provide, such information for a period of three years from the date that the product covered by the certificate was released from customs custody or removed from the bottler's premises, as applicable. The certification:
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (i) Must be from a governmental or government-approved entity having oversight or control over enological

                        practices in the producing country under the laws of that country;
                    </P>
                    <P>(ii) Must include the results of a laboratory analysis of the wine conducted either by a government laboratory of the producing country or by a laboratory certified by the government of the producing country; and</P>
                    <P>(iii) Must be in the possession of the importer at the time of release of the wine from customs custody and may cover multiple importations provided that the wine in each case is of the same brand and class or type, was made by the same producer, was subjected to the same cellar treatment, and conforms to the statements made on the certification.</P>

                        —(i) The following are alternatives to the producing country certification and laboratory analysis requirement described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section:
                    </P>
                    <P>(A) In the case of natural wine produced and imported subject to an international agreement or treaty specifying that the practices and procedures used to produce the wine are acceptable to the United States, no producing country certification and laboratory analysis is required, unless that international agreement or treaty requires a certification, in which case the importer must have in his or her possession at the time of release of the wine from customs custody an original or copy of that certification.</P>
                    <P>(B) If an importer of natural wine or its affiliate owns or controls a winery operating under a basic permit issued under part 1 of this chapter, in lieu of a producing country certification and laboratory analysis, the importer may self-certify that the practices and procedures used to produce the wine constitute proper cellar treatment. The self-certification must be either in the format set forth in paragraph (c) of this section with blocks 1 through 4 completed or in an alternative format that sets forth the same information, and it must be in the possession of the importer at the time of release of the wine from customs custody. In the case of self-certification the importer also must have at the time of release from customs custody records to establish that the requirements for self-certification are met.</P>
                    <P>(ii) The following are exempt from any certification requirement under this section:</P>
                    <P>(A) Natural wine produced before January 1, 2005. However, in this case, the importer must have in his or her possession at the time of release of the wine from customs custody records to establish that the wine was produced before January 1, 2005.</P>
                    <P>(B) Importations of natural wine that are of a personal, non-commercial nature. Examples of non-commercial importations include importations by travelers, gift shipments between individuals, and importations by diplomats for embassy or consular use.</P>
                    <P>(C) Importations of natural wine that constitute commercial samples. Commercial samples include sales samples, samples for trade shows, and samples for laboratory analysis.</P>
                    <P>(D) Imported natural wine held on board international passenger carriers, such as cruise ships or airliners.</P>

                    <P>(i) The importer must check box 3a and ensure that blocks 4 and 5 are completed if no alternative certification applies to the wine under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
                    <P>(ii) If paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) applies to the wine, the importer must check box 3b and complete the certification in block 4.</P>
                    <P>(4) If the certification is submitted subsequent to approval of a label, the importer must complete block 6 by including the TTB identification number from the certificate of label approval, TTB Form 5100.31.</P>

                <P>(3) A separate permit is not required for each port of entry. The application, Form 5150.33, may be completed to indicate the applicable ports of entry in which spirits will be withdrawn from customs custody.</P>
                <P>(4) A Government agency may specify on its application that it desires a single permit authorizing all sub-agencies under its control to procure and withdraw spirits free of tax under this subpart and subpart N of part 22 of this chapter; or, each Government location may individually file an application for a permit, Form 5150.33.</P>
                <P>(5) Each application for a permit shall be signed by the head of the agency or sub-agency, or the incumbent of an office which is authorized by the head of the agency or sub-agency, to sign.

                <P>Each Government agency must retain the original of its permit, Form 5150.33, on file. In the case of an agency holding a single permit for use of its sub-agencies, an attachment to the permit must list all locations authorized to withdraw spirits free of tax from customs custody. When withdrawing spirits free of tax from a port of entry, the agency, if filing electronically, must file its TTB-issued permit number along with the filing of any other information required by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to be filed with the customs entry. If the agency is not filing electronically, rather than file the TTB-issued permit number, the agency must make a copy of the permit available to the customs officer upon request.</P>

                <P>Denatured spirits and fuel alcohol are treated as spirits for purposes of this part and are subject to tax pursuant to § 27.40(a). The tax must be paid upon importation, with only two exceptions: Spirits may be withdrawn from customs custody free of tax for the use of the United States under subpart M of this part; and spirits may be withdrawn from customs custody and transferred to a distilled spirits plant, including a bonded alcohol fuel plant, without payment of tax under subpart L of this part. After transfer pursuant to subpart L, denatured spirits or fuel alcohol may be withdrawn free of tax in accordance with part 19 of this chapter if they meet the standards to conform either to a denatured spirits formula specified in part 21 of this chapter (for withdrawal from a regular distilled spirits plant) or a formula specified in § 19.746 of this chapter (for withdrawal from an alcohol fuel plant). Such withdrawal is permitted, even though the denaturation or rendering unfit for beverage use may have occurred, in whole or in part, in a foreign country. For purposes of this chapter, the denaturation or rendering unfit is deemed to have occurred at the distilled spirits plant (including the alcohol fuel plant), the proprietor of which is responsible for compliance with part 21 or § 19.746, as the case may be. Imported fuel alcohol shall also conform to the requirements of 27 CFR 19.742.</P>

                     A foreign producer who provides erroneous or fraudulent information that the appropriate TTB officer determines is material to the eligibility of the foreign producer to assign CBMA tax benefits under § 27.262 may have such eligibility revoked, for a period not to exceed three calendar years following the year of revocation, under the procedures set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. If the foreign producer has previously had its eligibility revoked under this section, any subsequent revocation may instead be permanent. In any case where a criminal conviction results from the foreign producer's providing of erroneous or fraudulent information as described above, eligibility will be permanently revoked.

                     Where the appropriate TTB officer has reason to believe that a foreign producer, including anyone acting on behalf of a foreign producer, has provided erroneous or fraudulent information as described in paragraph (a) of this section, such officer will provide a written notice of contemplated revocation to the foreign producer. Such notice will set forth the facts and analysis supporting the contemplated revocation, as well as the period of contemplated revocation. Written notice will be provided electronically to persons authorized to act on behalf of the foreign producer within the online foreign producer registration and assignment system as provided in § 27.260.

                     A foreign producer in receipt of a notice of contemplated revocation, or its representative, may submit a written response to the appropriate TTB officer explaining why the foreign producer believes the information at issue was not erroneous or fraudulent, or why such information is not material to the foreign producer qualifying for CBMA tax benefits. This response must

                    be submitted within 45 days of receipt of the written notice of contemplated revocation and must be submitted electronically through means specified in such notice. Any representative of the foreign producer in these proceedings must be authorized by the foreign producer pursuant to a duly executed power of attorney or other document deemed acceptable to the appropriate TTB officer. If the foreign producer does not submit a response within 45 days, the appropriate TTB officer will issue an order of revocation as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.

                     Following receipt of a foreign producer's response to a contemplated revocation, the appropriate TTB officer will consider the arguments raised in the response and issue an order either dismissing the contemplated revocation or imposing a revocation as authorized under paragraph (a) of this section. Any order imposing revocation will set forth the facts and analysis supporting the revocation, taking into consideration any response provided by the foreign producer under paragraph (c) of this section. The order will be provided electronically to the foreign producer or the foreign producer's representative in the matter.

                     A foreign producer may appeal an order of revocation issued under paragraph (d) of this section by submitting a written appeal to the appropriate TTB officer within 45 days of receipt of such order. The appeal must explain why the foreign producer believes its revocation is in error, supported by facts and analysis. The appeal must be submitted electronically through the means specified in the order of revocation. The appropriate TTB officer will issue a final decision by notifying the foreign producer within 90 days of receipt of the appeal whether the appeal is granted or denied, and the reasons for the determination. The appropriate TTB officer may extend this period of time once by an additional 90 days if the appropriate TTB officer requires additional time to consider the issues presented by an appeal and must notify the foreign producer of the extension within the initial 90-day period. If the appropriate TTB officer fails to issue a decision granting or denying the appeal within the applicable deadline, the appeal is denied and such denial will be considered a final decision.

                     A final decision from the appropriate TTB officer following appeal is required prior to application to the Federal courts for review of any order of revocation.

                     In any instance where an order imposing revocation of a foreign producer's eligibility for CBMA tax benefits is issued under paragraph (d) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will notify any importer having an assignment of CBMA tax benefits from that foreign producer of the revocation. In the event that the revocation is appealed and the appeal is granted pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will notify any importer having an assignment from that foreign producer of the dismissal of such revocation.
