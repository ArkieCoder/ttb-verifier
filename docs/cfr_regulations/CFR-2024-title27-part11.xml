However, the exchange of a product for equal quantities (case for case) of the same type and brand of product, in containers of another size is not considered an acquisition of “other” products and is not prohibited if there was no direct or implied privilege of return extended when the product was originally sold. Industry members may make price adjustments on products eligible for exchange under this paragraph.
